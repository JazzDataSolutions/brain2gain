## üí∞ Cost Estimation

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)
- **Container Orchestration**: $200-400/month (managed Kubernetes)
- **Database Cluster**: $300-600/month (PostgreSQL cluster)
- **Cache Cluster**: $150-300/month (Redis cluster)
- **Load Balancer**: $50-100/month (managed load balancer)
- **CDN**: $50-150/month (depending on traffic)
- **Monitoring**: $100-200/month (managed Prometheus/Grafana)

**Total Estimated**: $850-1,750/month (depending on scale and provider)

### Optimization Opportunities
- Start with minimal infrastructure and scale up based on actual usage
- Use managed services to reduce operational overhead
- Implement auto-scaling to optimize costs based on demand
- Monitor and optimize resource usage regularly
