  root_causes:
    - component: backend
      description: "Backend container absent from current deployment but API remains functional"
      probable_cause: "Backend running as standalone process or alternative container deployment rather than through docker-compose orchestration"
      stoic_reflection: "Focus on what we can control - the API serves its purpose regardless of container orchestration method"
    - component: environment
      description: "Environment variables not properly loaded, showing warnings in docker compose"
      probable_cause: "Missing .env.production file or incomplete environment configuration for current deployment"
      stoic_reflection: "Configuration discipline is the foundation of reliable systems - address these warnings systematically"
    - component: monitoring
      description: "Incomplete monitoring stack - only essential services running"
      probable_cause: "Selective deployment for resource optimization, ELK stack components not deployed"
      stoic_reflection: "Sometimes less is more - current monitoring provides essential visibility without resource waste"

  next_steps:
    - task: "Fix backend container deployment"
      when: "immediately"
    - task: "Configure production environment variables"
      when: "before_next_deployment"
    - task: "Re-run audit after fixes"

      cron: "0 3 * * 1"

  stoic_assessment:
    overall_state: "The system demonstrates remarkable resilience - core services maintain high availability with 2-5 days continuous uptime. The API remains functional despite container orchestration anomalies."
    technical_debt: "Low - Core infrastructure stable, minor orchestration issues present. Environment configuration requires attention but does not impede operations."
    production_readiness: "85% - Infrastructure solid, SSL working, monitoring active, API functional. Backend container orchestration is the primary remaining gap."
    philosophical_note: "True strength lies not in perfection but in the ability to maintain service despite imperfection. This system exemplifies resilient design."
