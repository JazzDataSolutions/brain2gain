## 🛠️ Required DNS Configuration

### **Correct DNS Records Needed**
```dns
# A Records (IPv4)
brain2gain.mx.           A    5.183.9.128
www.brain2gain.mx.       A    5.183.9.128
api.brain2gain.mx.       A    5.183.9.128
admin.brain2gain.mx.     A    5.183.9.128

# CNAME Records (Optional)
*.brain2gain.mx.         CNAME brain2gain.mx.
```

### **Current Incorrect DNS**
```dns
# Currently pointing to Cloudflare
brain2gain.mx.           A    104.21.40.188
brain2gain.mx.           A    172.67.156.77
```

## 🔧 Immediate Fix Required

### **Option 1: Update DNS to Point Directly to Server**
1. Access DNS management panel (domain registrar or DNS provider)
2. Remove Cloudflare IP addresses
3. Add A record: `brain2gain.mx` → `5.183.9.128`
4. Wait for DNS propagation (5-60 minutes)

### **Option 2: Configure Cloudflare Properly**
1. Access Cloudflare dashboard
2. Set up origin server to `5.183.9.128`
3. Configure SSL/TLS settings to "Full" or "Full (strict)"
4. Disable redirect rules causing loops

## 📋 Verification Steps After DNS Fix

```bash
# Test these after DNS change:
1. nslookup brain2gain.mx (should show 5.183.9.128)
2. curl https://brain2gain.mx (should return React app)
3. curl https://brain2gain.mx/test (should return success message)
4. curl https://brain2gain.mx/api/v1/utils/health-check/ (should return JSON)
```

## ⏱️ Impact Assessment
