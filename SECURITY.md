## 🚀 Supported Versions

We actively maintain security for the following versions:

| Version | Supported | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| 2.x.x (Microservices) | ✅ | Current development branch |
| 1.5.x | ✅ | Production stable with security backports |
| 1.0.x | ⚠️ | Critical security fixes only |
| < 1.0.0 | ❌ | No longer supported |

**Recommendation**: Always use the latest stable version for production deployments.

## 🏗️ Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: RS256 algorithm with key rotation
- **Refresh Tokens**: Secure storage with automatic rotation
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions per microservice
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Optional for admin accounts
- **OAuth2 Integration**: Google, Facebook social login

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for sensitive data
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt with 12 rounds minimum
- **PII Protection**: Tokenization for sensitive customer data
- **Database Security**: Encrypted connections, principle of least privilege

### Network Security
- **API Gateway**: Rate limiting, DDoS protection
- **CORS Policy**: Restrictive cross-origin resource sharing
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization with Pydantic
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries, ORM usage

## 🚨 Reporting Vulnerabilities

### How to Report
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email**: security@brain2gain.com
2. **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of vulnerability`
3. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key (available on request)

### What to Include
```markdown
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if known)
- Your contact information
```

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Based on severity (see table below)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix deployment

### Severity Levels
| Severity | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | 24 hours | Authentication bypass, data exposure |
| **High** | 72 hours | Privilege escalation, payment issues |
| **Medium** | 1 week | Information disclosure, CSRF |
| **Low** | 2 weeks | Rate limiting bypass, minor info leak |

## 🛡️ Security Measures
